I set up my files with HTML and CSS and started following a YouTube video. I'm currently working on the final project for the course, JavaScript for Beginners, which is a quiz application. The last thing I worked on was adding CSS. We learned how to use :root, which helps make changes more efficiently instead of editing each line individually. I was following a YouTube tutorial, and time I left on the video was 6:03.

I finished the YouTube tutorial and got most of it done. What’s left is fixing the "Next" button—it doesn’t show up when I select the correct answer on the first question. It only gives me a "Reset" button. That’s the only part left to complete this project.
